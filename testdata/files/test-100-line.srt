1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,270
(Heart Pairing)

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,970
Going beyond simple flirting,

3
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,970
now, we show you young people
who want to date...

4
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,510
someone they want to marry.

5
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,150
After eight years, after "Heart Signal,"
Channel A presents...

6
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,410
the best-ever dating reality show.

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,880
Welcome to Heart Pairing.

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,680
(Heart Pairing starts now.)

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,850
(Boosting dopamine)

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,090
The atmosphere is heated up.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,960
I have nine years of experience
in "Heart Signal."

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,890
I've been married for 20 years.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,390
I'm the right person
for hosting Heart Pairing.

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm Yoon Jong Shin.

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,960
You're just right for this.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,570
And here's someone
who rarely appears in variety shows.

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,640
Actress Lee Chung Ah joined us
in hosting the show.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,210
Hello, I'm Actress Lee Chung Ah.

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,380
The only dating show I watched
was "Heart Signal 4."

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,550
It really was...

21
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,980
- more dramatic than a drama.
- Right.

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,920
Hearing that the crew was creating
a new dating reality show,

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,990
I came here feeling excited,

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,790
- and it already makes my heart flutter.
- Right?

25
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,890
My heart flutters so much.

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,760
Actually for me, "Heart Signal" was...

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,960
the first and the last dating show
I watched.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,560
You should have appeared
in the show, Si Won.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,660
- That's right.
- Watching it now,

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,730
I feel I should have been there.

31
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,570
The mood there is so nice.

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,900
I also had an experience with this show.

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,240
Although my gut feeling isn't good,

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,440
watching them makes me feel...

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,240
that they're around my age.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,670
(Mimi feels that the residents
are around her age.)

37
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,280
Today, as a friend,

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,910
I will try to represent their position.

39
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,150
Mimi, you're the best age to marry, right?

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,280
I want to deny it,

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,590
but that's right.

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,790
I will do my best...

43
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,890
to look for someone.

44
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,790
And here's someone
who sent us a love call...

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,090
saying she wants to be in this show.

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
Dreams come true.

47
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,460
I watch all the dating shows,

48
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,900
but "Heart Signal" is the way to go.

49
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,700
- That's right.
- In my heart,

50
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,070
"Heart Signal" is a story that isn't over.

51
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,470
It's a show I really love.

52
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,610
So, joining in Heart Pairing...

53
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,440
makes me so happy.

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,450
Then...

55
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,510
can you predict who will be a couple
in the last episode?

56
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,780
I think I can guess it right.

57
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,420
- Watching only the first episode?
- I'll give it a try.

58
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,820
In the previous "Heart Signal,"

59
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,090
from flirting to dating,

60
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,560
young love of people in their 20s
was described.

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,360
This time, for one month,

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,600
the show describes the process
of looking for a partner...

63
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,200
the residents want to get married.

64
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,270
Dating and marriage are different...

65
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,670
in the mindset.

66
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,240
Are they quite different
from the beginning?

67
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,600
They surely are.

68
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,170
They have different weights.

69
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,710
I have a dim memory about it, though.

70
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,980
(I can't remember exactly.)

71
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,250
Now, from the beginning stage
of a relationship,

72
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,450
I get to think about a lot of things.

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,090
You can't just date someone
only because you're attracted.

74
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,160
If you marry just because
you're attracted...

75
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,290
You're dragged.

76
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,190
- You're dragged?
- For whole life.

77
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,660
I understand.

78
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,630
- It seems they went somewhere.
- With a passport.

79
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,570
There's a rumor they went to Europe.

80
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,870
Of Europe, they went
to the city of romance,

81
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,240
Tuscany.

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,400
In Italy.

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,940
They're in big trouble.
Something's going to happen.

84
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,740
I can't believe I'm its first viewer.

85
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,910
I'm excited.

86
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,080
(What kind of person
do you want to marry?)

87
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,150
(Someone who puts effort...)

88
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,120
(into work and family)

89
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,790
I'm already immersed.

90
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,860
(I want to spend time together.)

91
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,290
(How do you want to sleep
after getting married?)

92
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,460
(What's the monthly income
you expect as a couple?)

93
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
(- How will you do the housework?
- Do you want to have children?)

94
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,300
Now that they talk about marriage,

95
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,370
it feels totally different.

96
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,970
(33 questions on marriage)

97
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,800
(One person's thoughts...)

98
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,210
I got goosebumps. What's that?

99
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,640
(are made into a book.)

100
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,480
(Is there someone you like?
Then pick the book she wrote.)
